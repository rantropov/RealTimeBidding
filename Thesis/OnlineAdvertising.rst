Market share
************
The online advertising spent exceeded other advertising forms in mid 2012. The increase clearly shows the trend of future advertising form.
Online advertising is a rising advertising market. The market share grows by 15% - 20% every year [19]. The annual revenues in 2014 reaches 49.45 billion.
Performance based advertising contributes 66% in total advertising revenue in 2014 compare to 46% in 2005. CPM pricing model drops from 46% in 2005 to 33% in 2014.
The trend also shows shifting of online advertising model from offline contract pricing model to online real-time pricing model.

The rapid development of computation power has made the real-time computational advertising became achievable.
Computational advertising involves cutting edge technologies such as machine learning, data mining, natural language processing and optimization to present fine grind impression to end users in order to optimize advertising performance.
Advertisers are able to identify characteristics and interests of the target audience and ads exchange deliveries best-match ads impression to browsers to increase total revenue of both parties (advertiser and publisher).


Introduction to online advertising
**********************************

Online advertising can be categorized by **delivery method** and **compensation method**.

By delivery method
------------------

According to **delivery method** taxonomy, online advertising can be categorized into following categories:

 * Email Marketing
 * Search Engine Marketing
 * Social Media Marketing
 * Display Advertising
 * Mobile Marketing


Email Marketing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Email marketing is directly marketing a commercial message to a group of people using email. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It usually involves using email to send ads, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. Email marketing can be done to either sold lists or a current customer database. Broadly, the term is usually used to refer to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a merchant with its current or previous customers, to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and adding advertisements to email messages sent by other companies to their customers.

Madison Logic posted global data in April 2014 that claimed 122 billion emails are sent every hour

Search Engine Marketing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Keyword search** is the main form of search engine marketing, search engine


Social Media Marketing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Display Advertising
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mobile Marketing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By compensation method
----------------------

According to **compensation method** taxonomy, online advertising can be categorized into following categories:

 * Performance-based advertising
 * Contract-based advertising

Performance-based advertising
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. date::2016-Jan-14

Performance-base advertising (also called real-time advertising) is a marketing form that Ads buyer pays only when measurable results events happen.
In performance-based advertising, advertiser, publisher and ads Exchange build up a community response of common interests and supports. Three party are dedicate to deliver high quality impressions to target audience and generate high response events. In order to achieve this, the community has to best predict target audience's characteristics and interests. This problem has attracted both industrial and academic attentions. Solutions involve cutting-edge technologies such like machine learning, data mining, optimization etc.
Performance-based advertising are able to show fine grind impression to real-time user according to user interests and characteristics. Such has better results.

.. To be continue..

The performance-base advertising has taken the industry leading marketing form, the proportion of performance-base advertising revenue in online advertising has increased from 46% to 66% in past 10 years.



Contract-based advertising
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. date::2016-Jan-14

The old form of online advertising is contract-based advertising, also called offline advertising. In this pricing model, impressions are negotiated and sold in packs in offline in a fixed price.
Contract-based advertising unable to target real-time audience, the publisher shows impression to browsers in a time period or impression count basis. Also because the contract is negotiated offline before ads campaign, the system unable lacks flexibility to fit audience's interests. Thus resulted in a very low response rate.

Components of performance-based advertising platform
****************************************************

The components of online performance-base advertising platform are follows:

 * **Publisher**: A publisher is web resource such like web page or search engine which present advertisements to internet browser (consumer) though it's content or service.
 * **Advertiser**: A advertiser is the party has demands on marketing and branding, advertiser is seeking to buy impression opportunities to show it's creative to target audience.
 * **Ads Exchange**: Ads Exchange gathers impressions and sell them in a second-price (true value) auction basis.
 * **Data Management Platform and Data Provider**: DMP and DP manage and provide data to demands side
 * **Demand Side Platform**:
 * **Supply Side Platform**:

Budget Delivery/Allocation Optimization
***************************************

.. date::2016-Jan-14

The key issue of budge allocation problem is to learn the performance metric distribution.
Once obtained the performance distribution, advertisers can optimize their budget delivery according to the distribution.

Performance metrics include:

 * Return on investment (ROI)
 * Click though rate (CTR)


Couple things has to be keep in mind:

 * The budget delivery is to optimize the advertiser's goal, the advertiser's goal may differ from performance metrics
